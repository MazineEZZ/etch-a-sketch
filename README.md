# Etch-a-sketch

Welcome to Etch-a-sketch, This website was solely made for the odin project assignement. It has a wide range of super helpful features, and I'd recommend you give it a try on this demo [Live demo](https://mazineezz.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Features
    Drawing Canvas: A simple pixelated canvas that's ready to get painted by your imagination.

    Color Palette: A simple color picker, that lets your choose any color you'd like (Doesn't support color alpha/oppacity).

    Tools: for now there's three tools available at your hand; The rainbowfy, eraser and a darkening effect tool.

    Grid selecter: this lets you change the canvas size.

## Get Started.

    Start Drawing: Just start drawing dude...

Don't forget to give me a follow and this repo a star. Enjoyy!!
